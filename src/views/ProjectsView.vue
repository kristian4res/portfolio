          Solstice is a mock online travel booking platform, built using React (via CRA),
          React-Router, TailwindCSS and Firebase. Solstice was built as part of a course module,
          User Centred Web Development, which covered the importance of user experience and
          accessibility when designing a product. The development of this application followed the
          principles of Design Sprints, a methodology used to quickly validate ideas and solve
          challenges.
