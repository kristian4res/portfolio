      Hi there! My name is <b>Kristian, a software engineer</b> currently based in the United
      Kingdom. I'm currently working full time as a <b>DevSecOps engineer</b> within a
      cross-functional team for the <b>Office for National Statistics (ONS)</b>, the recognised
      national statistical institue of the UK.<br /><br />As a <b>lifelong learner</b>, I often
      spend my free time learning about new tech through personal projects and online courses to
      further hone my skills and knowledge. Aside from tech, I'm also an avid <b>gamer</b> and enjoy
      playing games in my free time, as well as being a <b>pet lover</b> (although I don't have a
      pet currently ðŸ¥²).
