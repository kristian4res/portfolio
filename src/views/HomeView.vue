          Hi there! My name is <b>Kristian, a software engineer</b> currently based in the United
          Kingdom. I'm currently working full time as a <b>DevSecOps engineer</b> within a
          cross-functional team for the <b>Office for National Statistics (ONS)</b>, the recognised
          national statistical institue of the UK.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a <b>lifelong learner</b>, I often spend my free time learning about new tech through
          personal projects and online courses to further hone my skills and knowledge. Aside from
          tech, I'm also a <b>food enthusiast</b> who enjoys trying out new recipes, in addition to
          being a <b>pet lover</b> (although I don't have a pet currently ðŸ¥²).
